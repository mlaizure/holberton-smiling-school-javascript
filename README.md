## Author

Hi! My name is Maddi Laizure. In another life I earned a Bachelor of Science Chemical Engineering at the University of Tulsa and worked as an engineer for close to 3 years. I love Irish stepdance and board games.

I did this project as a student at [Holberton School](https://holbertontulsa.com/) where I learned full stack web development. This project is a culmination of the technologies and concepts we learned about front-end development. These technologies and concepts include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Accessibility and responsive design.
